In this project, we have a Movie Reservation System, where the client can log into the 
system using a browser like Firefox, and book the tickets for a movie of his choice. The 
client can either book single or multiple tickets for the movies, as long as the tickets 
are available and not previously booked by other clients.

We have a database management system such as MySQL to store and retrieve the client information.
For this, the 'username', 'password' and 'database' used of the MySQL database stored in the 
server program should be changed to the values on the workstation the program is compiled and run. 

static char *user = "root";
static char *pass = "welcome123#";
static char *dbname = "test";

The above values are used in our server, which are to be replaced by the host username, password 
and database name respectively.

Also, an sql file "test.sql" is attached in this folder, which explains the SQL queries to be 
implemented on the database.

A make file is provided in this folder for compiling all the source coe files into a single 
object file.

Compile:

	make clean
	make

Run:
	./movieserver2 <port_number> <root_directory>

Example: If we are running at port 2000 and the root is /home/project
	./movieserver2 2000 /home/project
